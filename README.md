# Gamba
Simple slot machine game in Python.

The word "gamba" is slang that my friend group uses in place of the word gambling.

This is a simulated slot machine with terrible odds that are not in the user's favor.
Thankfully, this does not involve real money so you are not at risk of losing money.

When playing the game, the app will prompt the user to input a starting balance.
The balance will be updated as the user continues to play the game.

Parameters for the symbols and betting limits can be adjusted as desired.

# How to play
Download main.py into a folder. 
Make sure you have Python installed and run the file in your terminal with "python main.py".
Enjoy.
